# instagram-topic-prediction
This was Ironhack's Data Analytics final project.

The project goals included:

- Ask interesting and thoughful questions and find the data to answer them.
- Try to find multiple source for your data to make a more complete analysis.
- Apply statistical and machine learning techniques
- Create useful and clear graphs.
- Present your insights in a thoughtful, clear and accurate way.



Libraries/Tools used: 

(for data cleaning and EDA)
- pandas
- re
- wordcloud

(for machine learning) 
- nltk
- gensim
- statsmodels
- numpy

(visualisation):
- matplotlib
- Tableau


There is still room for improvement, I'd like to expand this project by: 
- developing a Instagram scraper
- test other machine learning models
